To make sure API is scalable on GCP
- API load balancing (should be enabled with cloud endpoints)
- Database is optimised, indexed. API queries are optimised.
- API rate limiting - cloud endpoints allows you to configure this
- Caching for frequently accessed data (e.g. all the read queries)
- Validate all inputs to prevent sql injection
